Here are some of my most recent projects. 

**Evaluating Customer Health & Using Data to Improve Segmentation**:
I completed an RFM (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value) analysis on our online customers. This method allowed me to put a quantitative score on the health of our customers. Every customer received a scaled score (between 1-3) for each category - how recently a purchased, how many times they purchased in a year, and how much money they spent in a year. From there, I added together those three individual scores, giving customers an RFM score of between 3-9 (9 being the highest). Using the RFM scores, I made recommendations to our marketing team around segmentation and which levers to pull to improve RFM scores over time.

**Modeling Customer Lifetime Value**:
Using the transaction data from all online PopSockets customers (over 2,000,000) rows of data, I modeled the rolling 12 month and 24 month lifetime value of our customers. 

**Study to Improve Number of Twitter Engagements - Fresh Tape Media**:
Fresh Tape Media (FTM) is a company that creates made-for-social video content for professional sports leagues, teams, athletes, and broadcasters. In this project, I used natural language processing (utilizing spaCy) to clean the data and engineer features. Next, I used supervised learning models (k-nearest neighbors, lasso regression, ridge regression, random forest) and clustering to be able to predict the success of a given tweet. Finally, I used feature importance to determine the features that most positively and negatively contribute to a tweet's success. 

**Unsupervised NLP Investigation to Improve Ability to Classify Speech Sources**:
In this study, I used natural language processing, clustering, and supervised learning models to classify sentences of inaugural speeches by president.

**Study to Improve Funding Success of Entrepreneurs on Kickstarter**:
For this study, I used a database of Kickstarter projects, engineered different features, compared the predictive and explanatory power of various models (naive bayes, k-NN, logistic regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, decision trees, random forest), and honed the accuracy of a lasso regression model.

**Investigating Ways to Close the Gap Between AP Exam test scores of Caucasian Students and Students of Color**: 
A unique twist to A/B testing using data from Advanced Placement exams. This project analyzes the potential impact of the ethnicity/race of the writers on the AP Composition and Literature exam on the test scores of students of different races.

**Investigating Ways to Improve the Optimization of Mental Health Resources**:
I analyzed data on accidental drug-related deaths, pulling out trends that would give insights to the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services around where/when to employ mental health resources.

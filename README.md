Check out some of my most recent projects. 

**Unsupervised NLP Investigation to Improve Ability to Classify Speech Sources**:
In this study, I used natural language processing, clustering, and supervised learning models to classify sentences of inaugural speeches by president.

**Study to Improve Funding Success of Entrepreneurs on Kickstarter**:
For this study, I used a database of Kickstarter projects, engineered different features, compared the predictive and explanatory power of various models (naive bayes, k-NN, logistic regression, lasso regression, ridge regression, decision trees, random forest), and honed the accuracy of a lasso regression model.

**Investigating Ways to Close the Gap Between AP Exam test scores of Caucasian Students and Students of Color**: 
A unique twist to A/B testing using data from Advanced Placement exams. This project analyzes the potential impact of the ethnicity/race of the writers on the AP Composition and Literature exam on the test scores of students of different races.

**Investigating Ways to Improve the Optimization of Mental Health Resources**:
I analyzed data on accidental drug-related deaths, pulling out trends that would give insights to the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services around where/when to employ mental health resources.
